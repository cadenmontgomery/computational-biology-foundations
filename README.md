# Computational Biology Foundations

This repository will document the foundational phase of what I wish to learn
in the field of computational biology. I will be self-taught utilizing the
MIT Online OpenCourseWare program to learn.

## Motivation
I intend to obtain a PhD in the field of computational biology. My undergraduate
degree is in Computer Information Systems with a minor in mathematics. Due to 
limited formal biology coursework in my undergraduate degree, this repository
serves as my bridge into the life science education I need to aquire to succeed.

## Topics Covered
- Molecular and Cell Biology

## Structure
Each directory contains:
- Conceptual notes
- Implementations from scratch where appropriate
- Small experiments on real biological datasets

## Sources
- MIT OpenCourseWare

## Status
Just Getting Started
